# Leetcode

I will use python to practice leetcode everyday for successfully hunting for a job at 2021 spring.

When I am in school, I am going to solve 3 problems everyday and write thoughts and analysis.

When I am in winter break, I will try as much as possible.

I believe if I stick to everyday, I will be successful next spring.
